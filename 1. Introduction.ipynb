    "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States. About 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer sometime in her life. In 2021, itâ€™s estimated among women in the United States there will be ~281,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer, ~49,290 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and ~43,600 women will die from breast cancer (cancer.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnosis of breast cancer begins when a patient or doctor discovers an abnormal calcification on a screening or examination. If a suspicious lump is found, imaging tests (i.e. Mammogram, Breast ultrasound, PET/CT, Scintimammography) may be performed in order to determine if a breast lump is malignant (cancerous) or benign. Imaging tests are also utilized in routine screenings for breast cancer detection without the notable presence of a lump or mass. However, a biopsy, the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope, is the only test that can make a definite diagnosis on whether a tumor is malignant or benign.\n",
